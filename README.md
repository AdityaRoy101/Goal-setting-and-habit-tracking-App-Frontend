The Project is divided into several Parts also complexity increase when you go deeper in this project.

I have used Resuable Components, concept of protected routes, used axois

For styling and css i have used Tailwind.css

Used Ant Design Material Library for quick components buildUp

In this Project the user signUp and then he should signIn with the same email, the project is best for habit and goals tracking, i personally love the UI/UX of the project very much the simple UI and that's how i built it, there are many components like goalsProvider, goalsViewer, taskProvider, taskViewer, Due to increasing complexity i have broken the components by parts so that will be easy for anybody to go through.
